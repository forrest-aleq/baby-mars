                          Spend/Year
Small Clubs      2,800    $3,600          $10.1M
Medium Clubs     1,600    $12,000         $19.2M
Large Clubs      400      $35,000         $14.0M
Enterprise       200      $75,000         $15.0M

Total TAM                              $58.3M
```

**Dockwa Serviceable Market:**
- Immediate opportunity: $15-20M (clubs already considering software upgrades)
- 3-year opportunity: $35-40M (as market matures)
- 5-year opportunity: $50-55M (full market penetration)
