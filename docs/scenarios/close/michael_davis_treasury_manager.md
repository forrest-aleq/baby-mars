# Story 17: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Cash Forecast Preparation & Interbank Transfer Management
## **Difficulty Level: 3 (Very Hard)**

### Michael's Weekly Cash Orchestration Process

Michael Davis opens his laptop at 8:30 AM every Tuesday morning, 24 hours after Angela's weekly bank balance collection, ready to tackle what he considers the most complex aspect of treasury management: transforming raw cash position data into actionable cash flow forecasts and executing the intricate dance of interbank transfers that keeps StorageCorner's 23 properties optimally funded. As Treasury Manager, Michael must balance competing priorities: maintaining adequate liquidity at each property, optimizing cash yields through concentration, minimizing banking fees, and ensuring compliance with loan covenants across multiple credit facilities.

His workstation reflects the complexity of modern treasury management: dual monitors displaying cash flow models and bank portals, printed loan agreements with highlighted covenant requirements, and a sophisticated Excel forecasting system that has evolved over 18 months into StorageCorner's primary cash management tool. Michael knows that poor cash positioning can cost StorageCorner thousands in overdraft fees or missed investment opportunities, while excessive cash hoarding reduces overall portfolio returns.
