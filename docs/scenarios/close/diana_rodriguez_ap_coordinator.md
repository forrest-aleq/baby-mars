# Story 25: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Email Triage for Payment Requests & AP Processing
## **Difficulty Level: 1 (Medium)**

### Diana's Daily AP Email Battlefield

Diana Rodriguez arrives at her workstation at 7:15 AM every weekday morning, immediately opening her laptop to face what feels like an endless digital avalanche: the StorageCorner accounts payable inbox that receives 150-200 vendor emails daily containing everything from legitimate invoices requiring immediate payment to spam marketing disguised as billing notices to urgent vendor communications about account status changes that could impact critical property operations. As AP Coordinator, Diana serves as the critical first filter in StorageCorner's payment processing chain - triaging hundreds of payment-related emails with the precision of an emergency room nurse, ensuring legitimate invoices flow smoothly to payment while preventing fraudulent requests, duplicate payments, and processing errors that could disrupt vendor relationships or compromise financial controls.

Her desk setup reflects the multi-tasking intensity of modern AP coordination: laptop displaying email client with multiple inbox views, printed vendor contact lists with highlighted priority suppliers, smartphone for direct vendor communication, and multiple monitors showing Roam payment platform, QuickBooks invoice tracking, and vendor management systems. Diana knows that successful AP coordination requires equal parts detective work, diplomatic communication, and systematic organization - transforming the chaos of vendor emails into orderly payment workflows that maintain StorageCorner's reputation for reliable, accurate vendor payments.

**7:22 AM - The Daily Email Inbox Analysis and Priority Assessment**

Diana opens her comprehensive AP email management system, beginning with overnight email accumulation:
