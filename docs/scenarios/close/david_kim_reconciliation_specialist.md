# Story 21: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Cash Reconciliation and Variance Analysis
## **Difficulty Level: 2 (Hard)**

### David's Daily Cash Validation Process

David Kim arrives at his workstation at 8:45 AM every Thursday morning, armed with Lisa's weekly cash forecasts and facing the critical task of reconciling projected cash flows against actual bank balances to identify variances, investigate discrepancies, and ensure the accuracy of StorageCorner's cash management processes. As Reconciliation Specialist, David serves as the quality control checkpoint that validates the entire cash management chain - from property-level collections through corporate activities to investment placement and banking relationships.

His desk setup reflects the detail-oriented nature of reconciliation work: three monitors displaying bank portals, cash flow models, and variance analysis spreadsheets, printed bank statements with highlighted discrepancies, and detailed reconciliation templates that capture every dollar of variance across StorageCorner's complex cash ecosystem. David knows that accurate reconciliation not only ensures financial integrity but also provides the feedback loop that improves forecasting accuracy and identifies operational improvements.

• **Mountain West Legal:** $1,300 (Partnership agreement amendments)
• **Total Legal Fees:** $3,700 (vs. $0 forecasted for routine legal)

• **Bank Processing:** Accelerated to November 26, 2025 (Tuesday before holiday)
• **Notification:** Bank email sent November 24th (after forecast completed)

**Process Improvement Note:** Need to incorporate banking holiday schedules into debt service forecasting.

```

**Missoula Expansion Investigation (-$21,900):**
David contacts the project manager to understand the spending acceleration:

**Project Manager Response:** "Weather forecast shows early snow coming next week. We accelerated roofing and exterior work to avoid delays. This pulls forward December spending into November, but keeps us on overall budget and schedule."

**Bozeman Development Investigation (-$23,400):**
David reviews municipal billing and permitting records:

**Unexpected Permitting Costs:**
• **City Planning Review:** $8,400 (additional design review required)
• **Impact Fees:** $12,700 (higher than initially quoted)
• **Utility Connections:** $2,300 (electrical upgrade requirements)

**Variance Classification:** Legitimate project costs but not captured in weekly forecast due to uncertain timing of municipal billing.

**11:07 AM - The Investment Activities Reconciliation**

David investigates a significant favorable variance from investment activities:

```

**Treasury Bill Early Redemption Investigation:**
David accesses TreasuryDirect.gov to understand the unexpected redemption:

**TreasuryDirect Account Review:**
• **Original T-Bill:** $247,000 26-week bill purchased May 2025
• **Expected Maturity:** December 15, 2025
• **Actual Maturity:** November 26, 2025
• **Reason:** Special Treasury call provision (rare but legitimate)

**Treasury Call Provision Research:**
David discovers that the Treasury Department occasionally calls bills early when interest rate management requires it. This is unusual but not unprecedented.

**Reinvestment Impact:** $247,000 now available for immediate reinvestment at current rates (potentially favorable given rising rate environment).

**11:34 AM - The Banking Fees and Miscellaneous Items Reconciliation**
