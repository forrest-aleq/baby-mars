# Story 13: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Expense Variance Investigation & Reconciliation
## **Difficulty Level: 3 (Very Hard)**

### Robert's Detective Work in Budget Variance Analysis

Robert Kim arrives at StorageCorner's finance department at 7:30 AM on November 5th, armed with his extra-large coffee and facing what he's come to call "Variance Investigation Monday" - the monthly process of digging into every significant budget variance across StorageCorner's 23 self-storage properties to determine which require manager explanations versus which can be resolved through analysis. As the Finance Analyst responsible for budget integrity, Robert has developed a systematic detective approach that combines financial analysis, operational knowledge, and investigative skills to maintain budget accuracy across the portfolio.

His desk setup reflects the complexity of variance investigation: three monitors displaying QuickBooks, Excel, and vendor databases simultaneously, printed vendor contracts for quick reference, and a detailed flowchart he's developed for variance investigation methodology. Robert knows that hasty variance investigations lead to unnecessary manager follow-ups, while insufficient analysis can miss important operational issues.

**7:38 AM - The Monthly Variance Threshold Analysis and Scope Assessment**

Robert opens his variance investigation dashboard in Excel and reviews the October variance flags across all 23 properties:

**Variance Flagging Criteria:**
• **Percentage Threshold:** >10% variance from budget
• **Dollar Threshold:** >$500 absolute variance
• **Combined Threshold:** >5% AND >$250 (for smaller expense categories)
• **Seasonal Adjustment:** Factors in known seasonal patterns
• **Historical Pattern:** Compares to same month prior year

**October 2025 Variance Summary:**
• **Total Budget Line Items Reviewed:** 207 (23 properties × 9 average categories)
• **Variances Flagged:** 43 items (20.8% of total)
• **Favorable Variances:** 18 items (spending below budget)
• **Unfavorable Variances:** 25 items (spending above budget)
• **Investigation Required:** 43 items (every variance gets analyzed)

**Variance Severity Classification:**
```
Severity Level    Criteria                Count    Investigation Priority
