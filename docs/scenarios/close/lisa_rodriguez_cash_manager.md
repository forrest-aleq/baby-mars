# Story 20: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Weekly Cash Forecasting and Liquidity Management
## **Difficulty Level: 2 (Hard)**

### Lisa's Forward-Looking Cash Orchestration

Lisa Rodriguez opens her workstation at 8:00 AM every Wednesday morning, 24 hours after Michael Davis completes his weekly cash positioning analysis, ready to build forward-looking cash flow forecasts that extend 13 weeks into the future and provide the strategic foundation for StorageCorner's liquidity management, capital allocation, and risk assessment. As Cash Manager, Lisa must translate current cash positions into actionable forecasts that anticipate seasonal variations, debt service requirements, capital project funding needs, and potential investment opportunities across StorageCorner's growing portfolio.

Her desk setup reflects the forward-looking nature of her role: multiple monitors displaying cash flow models, seasonality analysis, and scenario planning tools, printed loan amortization schedules with payment dates highlighted, and sophisticated Excel forecasting models that incorporate property-level performance, corporate activities, and macroeconomic factors. Lisa knows that accurate cash forecasting determines StorageCorner's ability to maintain operations, pursue growth opportunities, and optimize returns while maintaining adequate liquidity buffers.
