# Story 15: StorageCorner Real Estate Investment - Hiring a Human Report Monitor as Stopgap Solution
## **Difficulty Level: 2 (Hard)**

### Thomas's Strategic Human Bridge Implementation

Thomas Chen arrives at StorageCorner's finance department at 7:45 AM on November 10th, carrying the weight of a decision that reflects both the limitations of current technology and the urgent need for operational efficiency. As Finance Director overseeing financial operations for 23 self-storage properties, Thomas has reached the conclusion that the gap between QuickBooks data and property manager engagement requires a dedicated human intermediary - at least temporarily while longer-term automation solutions are developed.

His corner office reflects the strategic nature of his role: whiteboards covered with organizational charts and process flow diagrams, multiple monitors displaying portfolio performance dashboards, and a stack of resumes for the "Financial Reporting Coordinator" position he's about to create. Thomas knows that hiring a person to do work that should eventually be automated seems counterintuitive, but the business impact of poor manager engagement with budget data has reached a critical threshold.

**7:53 AM - The Business Case Analysis for Human Intervention**

Thomas opens his comprehensive analysis documenting why a human bridge solution is necessary:

**Current Process Inefficiencies:**
• **Jennifer (Finance Manager):** Spends 2.5 days monthly on report generation and distribution
• **Property Managers:** 47% don't engage with budget reports consistently
• **Robert (Finance Analyst):** Spends 6+ hours monthly chasing manager responses
• **Patricia (Operations Manager):** Spends 4-6 hours monthly on accountability follow-up

**Total Current Labor Cost:**
• **Jennifer:** 20 hours/month @ $65/hour = $1,300
• **Robert:** 6 hours/month @ $58/hour = $348
• **Patricia:** 5 hours/month @ $62/hour = $310
• **Total Monthly Cost:** $1,958 in senior staff time

**Performance Impact Analysis:**
• **Unexplained Variances:** 35% of budget variances lack manager explanations
• **Issue Resolution Time:** Average 12.4 days to resolve budget discrepancies
• **Manager Engagement Quality:** 3.1/5.0 average engagement score
• **Process Scalability:** Current approach cannot handle planned portfolio growth to 45 properties

**Proposed Human Bridge Solution:**
• **Position:** Financial Reporting Coordinator (full-time)
• **Salary Range:** $55,000-$65,000 annually + benefits
• **Total Cost:** ~$78,000 annually (including benefits and overhead)
• **ROI Calculation:** $78,000 cost vs. $23,496 in senior staff time savings = $54,504 net savings in Year 1

**Implementation Plan:**
- Amanda Rodriguez selected, start date November 20th
- 30-day onboarding with full responsibility transition
- Performance metrics and quarterly reviews established
- Clear evolution path to automation support role

**Risk Mitigation:**

Request approval to proceed with offer and onboarding.

Thomas Chen, Finance Director"

Thomas reflects on the decision as he prepares for lunch: hiring a human to do work that should eventually be automated feels counterintuitive in 2025, but the business reality is that technology adoption requires human change management, relationship building, and process optimization that can't be programmed. Amanda's role represents not just a stopgap solution, but a strategic investment in the human elements that make technology successful - building the foundation for StorageCorner's evolution toward truly automated, scalable financial operations across their growing Mountain West portfolio.
