# OPEN QUESTIONS - Need Answers to Update README Accurately

## ⚠️ CRITICAL TIMELINE ISSUES

### What I Think I Know (BUT NEED CONFIRMATION)
- "where-it-started" conversation = End of July 2025 ✓
- ALL research started August 2025 (after where-it-started) ✓
- Research burst: Aug-Oct 2025 ✓
- Papers 19 & 20 (LTL + PTD) = Oct 14, 2025 ✓
- ACRE = Early September (~Sept 6), NOT Sept 29 ✓

### What I'm CONFUSED About

#### 1. README Timeline vs Reality
The README shows:
```
June 5, 2025       → Competence-Based Adaptive Autonomy
June 8, 2025       → Context-Conditional Beliefs
June 12, 2025      → Moral Asymmetry with Event Sourcing
June 15, 2025      → AI Years Framework
June 18, 2025      → Birth System for Cold Start
June 22, 2025      → Causal Attribution
July 8, 2025       → Moral Asymmetry as Learning Multiplier
July 18, 2025      → ACT Benchmark
July 25, 2025      → Hierarchical Beliefs with Cascading Updates
```

**BUT YOU SAID:** "there is 0 research before august"

**QUESTIONS:**
- Are these June/July dates when you FIRST THOUGHT about the concepts (during where-it-started conversation)?
- Or are they INVENTION dates (when you actually formalized/wrote them)?
- Should ALL of these be moved to August-October 2025?
- Or is there a distinction between "conceptual origin" and "research paper invention"?

#### 2. What Does "Invention Date" Mean?
**QUESTIONS:**
- Is it when you first had the idea?
- When you wrote the first draft?
- When you formalized it into a paper?
- When you decided to make it a separate paper?

Example: Competence-Based Autonomy
- README says "June 5, 2025 (Gemini conversation)"
- But was that conversation part of where-it-started?
- When did it become Paper 1?
- When was the DRAFT actually written?

#### 3. Missing Papers 19 & 20
README says "18 papers" but we have:
- Paper 19: Latent Trajectory Learning (Oct 14, 2025)
- Paper 20: Planner-Translator-Driver (Oct 14, 2025)

**QUESTIONS:**
- Are these papers #19 and #20 or were they renumbered?
- Should README say "20 papers" now?
- Are there other papers missing from README?

#### 4. ACRE Date Confusion
README says: "September 29, 2025 (Aletheia submission)"

**BUT YOU SAID:** "acre was like early september. everything else is correct"

**QUESTIONS:**
- Is ACRE's invention date early September (~Sept 6)?
- Is Sept 29 the Aletheia CHI submission date (which REFERENCES ACRE)?
- Or is Aletheia a DIFFERENT paper about Competence-Based Autonomy?
- Is ACRE the same as "Category-Specific Invalidation Thresholds"?

## 📚 PAPER TAXONOMY QUESTIONS

### Current Categories (from blog posts)
- Memory
- Beliefs
- Autonomy
- Social
- Systems
- Benchmarks
- Reflections
- Architecture
- Implementation
- Cognition
- Foundations

### README Has Different Tiers
- Tier 1: Genuinely Novel (★★★★★) - 7 Papers
- Tier 2: Novel Applications (★★★★☆) - 11 Papers

**QUESTIONS:**
- Should we use Tiers or Categories for organizing papers?
- How do the blog categories map to README tiers?
- Are some papers in multiple categories?
- Which taxonomy is correct/preferred?

### Specific Paper Categorization Uncertainties

**Competence-Based Autonomy:**
- Blog category: "Autonomy"
- README tier: "Tier 1: Genuinely Novel"
- Is this also "Systems" or "Architecture"?

**Three-Column Working Memory:**
- Blog category: "Memory"
- README tier: "Tier 1: Genuinely Novel"
- Is this also "Cognition" or "Architecture"?

**ACT Benchmark:**
- Blog category: "Benchmarks"
- README tier: "Tier 2: Novel Applications"
- Should benchmarks be considered "applications" or their own tier?

---

## 🗂️ FILE NAMING & NUMBERING QUESTIONS

### Draft Files
I see files like:
- `01-competence-based-autonomy.md`
- `19-latent-trajectory-learning.md`
- `20-planner-translator-driver.md`

**QUESTIONS:**
- Are the numbers (01, 02, etc.) chronological by invention date?
- Or are they just organizational?
- Should they match the invention timeline?
- Are files 19 & 20 actually numbered or did I misread?

### Blog Post Files
Currently dated like:
- `2025-08-01-competence-based-autonomy.md`
- `2025-10-14-latent-trajectory-learning.md`

**QUESTIONS:**
- Do these dates represent invention dates?
- Or when the blog post was written?
- Or when you want them published?
- Should they match the README timeline exactly?

## 📅 SPECIFIC DATE CONFIRMATIONS NEEDED

### Papers I'm Confident About (from your corrections):
- Aug 5: Interference-Based Memory Decay ✓
- Aug 12: Peak-End Rule ✓
- Aug 20: Self-Correcting Validation ✓
- Sept 6 (early Sept): ACRE ✓
- Oct 12: Duration Estimation ✓
- Oct 14: LTL + PTD ✓
- Oct 18: Social Awareness ✓
- Oct 19: Cognitive Engrams ✓
- Oct 20: Three-Column Working Memory ✓
- Oct 25: Time-Based Context Activation ✓

### Papers I'm UNCERTAIN About (currently in README as June/July):
1. Competence-Based Autonomy - June 5 or August?
2. Context-Conditional Beliefs - June 8 or August?
3. Moral Asymmetry Event Sourcing - June 12 or August?
4. AI Years - June 15 or August?
5. Birth System - June 18 or August?
6. Causal Attribution - June 22 or August?
7. Moral Asymmetry Multiplier - July 8 or August?
8. ACT Benchmark - July 18 or August?
9. Hierarchical Beliefs - July 25 or August?

**NEED:** Actual invention dates for papers 1-9

## 🔬 PUBLICATION STATUS QUESTIONS

### README Says:
- "First drafts completed October 26, 2025"
- "CHI 2026 (Submit Nov 2025): Competence-Based Autonomy"
- "Aletheia submission September 29, 2025"

**QUESTIONS:**
- Have any papers been submitted yet?
- Is Aletheia submission completed?
- Are Papers 19 & 20 (LTL + PTD) also first drafts?
- Or are they more polished?
- What's the status of each paper? (draft / submitted / accepted / published)

### Target Venues
README lists target venues for each paper.

**QUESTIONS:**
- Are these definite targets or possibilities?
- Have any been submitted?
- Should we add Papers 19 & 20 venue targets?

---

## 🎯 NOVELTY CLAIMS QUESTIONS

README categorizes novelty as:
- Tier 1: Genuinely Novel (★★★★★)
- Tier 2: Novel Applications (★★★★☆)

**From state_of_the_union.md** there's a section:
"Part II: True Innovations vs. Incremental Improvements"

**QUESTIONS:**
- Should README novelty tiers match state_of_the_union analysis?
- Are there papers claimed as novel that are actually incremental?
- Should we add a "Tier 3: Incremental Improvements" category?
- How do Papers 19 & 20 fit into novelty tiers?

---

## 📊 STATISTICS QUESTIONS

README says:
- "Total Papers: 18 completed first drafts"
- "Total Word Count: ~145,000 words"
- "Invention Period: June 5 - October 25, 2025 (142 days)"

**WITH PAPERS 19 & 20:**
- Total Papers: 20?
- New word count with LTL + PTD?
- Invention Period: August ? - October 25, 2025?

**QUESTIONS:**
- Should we update all statistics?
- What's the word count for Papers 19 & 20?
- What's the ACTUAL invention period (not the June-Oct shown)?

---

## 🔄 CROSS-REFERENCE QUESTIONS

### Papers 19 & 20 Cross-References
I added cross-references:
- LTL references PTD (both Oct 14)
- PTD references LTL (both Oct 14)

**QUESTIONS:**
- Do other papers reference LTL or PTD?
- Should earlier papers reference later ones? (chronologically impossible?)
- Are there other cross-reference relationships I'm missing?

### ACRE References
**QUESTIONS:**
- Which papers reference ACRE?
- Should they reference "early September" or specific date?
- Is ACRE referenced in papers before September? (would be chronologically wrong)

---

## 🎨 FORMATTING & PRESENTATION QUESTIONS

### README Structure
**QUESTIONS:**
- Should we organize by date (chronological)?
- Or by tier/novelty?
- Or by category (Memory, Beliefs, etc.)?
- Or keep current structure?

### Blog Posts vs Drafts
**QUESTIONS:**
- Are blog posts simplified versions of drafts?
- Should they have matching dates?
- Should blog post categories match paper categories?

---

## ✅ WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

Please answer:

1. **TIMELINE:** What are the ACTUAL invention dates for papers 1-9? (Currently shown as June/July)

2. **PAPER COUNT:** Is it 18 or 20 papers? Are Papers 19 & 20 officially part of the collection?

3. **CATEGORIES:** Should we use Tiers (1 & 2) or Categories (Memory, Beliefs, etc.) or both?

4. **ACRE:** Invention date = Sept 6? And Sept 29 = Aletheia submission of Competence paper?

5. **INVENTION DATE DEFINITION:** What does "invention date" mean? First thought? First draft? Final draft?

6. **NOVELTY:** Are the tier 1/tier 2 distinctions still accurate? Where do Papers 19 & 20 fit?

7. **PUBLICATION STATUS:** What's the status of each paper? Draft / Under Review / Submitted / Published?

8. **CROSS-REFERENCES:** Which papers reference which other papers?

Once you answer these, I can make the README 100% accurate.
