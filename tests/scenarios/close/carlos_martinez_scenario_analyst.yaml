  input: Build me a recession scenario model for Q1 2026 through Q4 2027. Use GDP
    growth of -1.8%, unemployment at 7.8%, interest rates at 3.75%, and model the
    impacts on occupancy and rent across our property segments - business storage,
    consumer storage, climate-controlled, vehicle storage, and premium locations.
